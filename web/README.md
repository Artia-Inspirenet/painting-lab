## How to run

Go where `manage.py` is and run `bash run.sh`. This time that file is under **_base** which is the django project name. App name is **artia**. If you are using *virtualenvwrapper*, you can easily make virtual python environment by specifying virtual environment name like `bash run.sh artia-web-tool`.

Default admin name is **admin** and password is changable by editing *superuserpass.txt*.

If You wnat to clean all of stuff, run `bash run.sh clean`. Failing error removing directory is normal.
